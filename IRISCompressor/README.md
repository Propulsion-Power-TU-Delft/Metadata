## Information

The impeller features 7 main blades and 7 seven splitter blade passages.
The geometry of the impeller and the diffuser are provided in ".crv" and ".igs" formats.
The ".crv" files can be directly imported in Ansys Turbogrid.
Alternatively, the ".igs" file can be opened in most of the CAD softwares.
